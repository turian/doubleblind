We use Twitter authentication as described in:
    http://agileweb.wordpress.com/2009/04/28/step-by-step-guide-to-use-sign-in-with-twitter-with-django/#comment-75


GETTING STARTED:
* Create localsettings.py, and add the following three values (with appropriate values):
    SECRET_KEY = ''
    CONSUMER_KEY = ""
    CONSUMER_SECRET = ""
I am not sure how to generate a value for the first one, just grab one
that Django generates for you.  For the other two values, you will need
to register with Twitter at http://twitter.com/oauth_clients

* Install the requirements listed at the top here:
